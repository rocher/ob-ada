* Introduction
Ada is a strongly-typed programming language that supports structured,
object-oriented, distributed and concurrent programming. Ada is suitable for all
kind of systems and programming needs, ranging from embedded to large systems.
Ada is named after [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace][Ada Lovelace]].

SPARK is a programming language based on the Ada programming language. SPARK is
formally defined and intended for the development of high integrity applications
used in safety-critical systems.

Ada and SPARK source code blocks can be used to create procedures and functions,
compile and run them as well as prove correctness of SPARK programs.

For further introductory reading, please visit [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)][Ada]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARK_(programming_language)][SPARK]] wikipedia pages.

Important: Do not confuse with [[https://spark.apache.org/][Apache SPARK]], which is a completely different
language.

* Requirements and Setup
  1. You must have a recent Ada compiler available on your computer. To prove
     SPARK programs, you must have also have SPARK tools installed. Commonly
     available in most system, and free options, are:

     * [[https://gcc.gnu.org/][GNAT FSF]] is a free and complete Ada compiler integrated into the GCC (the
       GNU Compiler Collection)
     * [[https://www.adacore.com/download][GNAT Community]] from AdaCore includes SPARK support
     * GNAT FSF + AdaCore SPARK tool set: see how to [[https://github.com/AdaCore/spark2014/blob/master/Makefile][manually compile SPARK]]

     Other compilers can be used as well, but have been not tested. For more
     information see the list of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_compilers#Ada_Compilers][Ada Compilers]].

  2. Although it is not necessary, it is highly recommended to install [[https://www.nongnu.org/ada-mode/][ada-mode]]
     support for Emacs, which can be obtained from the [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/ada-mode.html][GNU Elpa]] package
     repository.

  3. Make Babel load Ada/SPARK support. Type
     : M-x customize-variable org-babel-load-languages
     and add the Ada/SPARK languages.

  * Installation and configuration of language software
  * Emacs configuration
  * Org-mode configuration (org-babel-do-load-languages)

* Babel Features for Ada/SPARK Source Code Blocks
** Custom Variables
Ada/SPARK support can be customized with the following variables:

  * =ob-ada-spark-compile-cmd= ::
    set the command to invoke the Ada compiler; default value is =gnatmake=

  * =ob-ada-spark-version= ::
    default Ada version passed to the compiler; default value is =2012=; the
    only compiler supported is =gnatmake=, so this argument will be passed to
    the compiler as, e.g., =-gnat2012=.

  * =ob-ada-spark-compiler-enable-assertions= ::
    flag to enable Ada assertions; default value is ~-gnata~

  * =ob-ada-spark-prove-cmd= ::
    set the command to invoke the SPARK formal verification tool; default value
    is =gnatprove=; could be a shell script to invoke =gnatprove= and present
    the results in a different way

  * =ob-ada-spark-skel-initial-string= ::
    this is the header inserted in files generated with ~org-babel-tangle~; it
    does not interfere with the default header inserted by =ada-mode=.

** Header Arguments
There is one header argument that switches from execution to formal
verification: =:prove=. If you set =:prove t=, then the source block will be
given to =gnatprove= for formal verification of the SPARK code. With any other
value the source block will be given to =gnatmake= (or to the compiler defined
in the =ob-ada-spark-compile-cmd= custom variable) for Ada/SPARK compilation and
execution.

The common header arguments for both scenarios are:

  * =:prove= ::
    must be =nil= (default) or =t=; when set to =t= formal verification is
    performed, otherwise Ada/SPARK evaluation is performed.

  * =:unit= ::
    must be a valid Ada unit name or =nil= (default); when set to =nil=, Babel
    will generate a unit name compatible with =gnatmake= and =gprbuild= naming
    conventions.

*** Arguments for Ada/SPARK evaluation
These are flags and parameters passed to =gnatmake= (or the Ada compiler);

  * =:assertions= ::
    must be =nil= or =t= (default); flag to pass to the compiler to enable
    assertions.

  * =template= :: <<template>>
    name of the template to be used in case you want to evaluate a partial
    Ada/SPARK program; for example, the most basic use is =:template proc-main=
    to wrap your code inside a =Main= procedure using the =Ada.Text_IO= package.

  * =:version= ::
    can be =83=, =95=, =2005=, =2012=, =2020= or =mil=; specific Ada version to
    be used with the current source block. Overrides the value of the
    =ob-ada-spark-version= variable.

  * =:with= ::
    list of packages; each one will be replaced by =with PACKAGE; use PACKAGE=
    in the preamble of the [[template]].

*** Arguments for SPARK formal verification
These are flags and parameters passed to =gnatprove=. When set to =nil= no flag
or argument will be passed to =gnatprove= so the default values will be used.

The header arguments are:

  * =:assumptions:= ::
    must be =nil= (default) or =t= ; output assumptions information.

  * =:level= ::
    must be =0=, =1=, =2=, =3=, =4= (default) or =nil=; set the level of proof
    (=0= = faster, =4= = more powerful).

  * =:mode= ::
    must be =check=, =check_all=, =flow=, =prove=, =all= (default) or =nil=; set
    the mode of =gnatprove=.

  * =:pedantic= ::
    must be =nil= (default) or =t=; use a strict interpretation of the Ada
    standard.

  * =:report= ::
    must be =fail=, =all= (default), =provers=, =statistics= or =nil=; set the
    report mode of =gnatprove=.

  * =:warnings= ::
    must be =off=, =continue=, =error= or =nil= (default); set the warning mode
    of =gnatprove=.

See the documentation of =gnatprove= for more information.

*** Arguments for literate programming
Org Babel provides the =var= header argument to pass values to source code
blocks. For example, in =C= you can write =:var i=1= and then use =i= inside the
source code block. Internally, this parameter also /declares/ the variable =i=
as an =int=. This mechanism is also implemented for other programming languages
supported in Babel.

Because Ada and SPARK are strongly typed programming languages, it has no sense
to use this =:var= argument to introduce /shadowed/ declarations. It's
preferable to let programmers choose the appropriate type of a variable:
=Integer=, =Natural= or =Positive=. So we decided that it's better to not to
implement this mechanism in Ada/SPARK.

Instead, we can take advantage of the =:var= header argument to perform /literal
substitutions/ of the indicated variables with the result from evaluating
them. For example, suppose that a source code block wants to open a file in the
same directory than the orgmode file. The compiled code is executed from a
temporary directory managed by Babel. That mean that a path is required in the
file name. This path depends on the current working directory of the orgmode
file, which can be different for virtually each user.

The solution is then to provide a =__Path__= literate substitution with the
following ~ELisp~ form:

#+begin_example

#+header: :var __Path__=(file-name-directory (buffer-file-name (current-buffer)))
#+begin_src ada

  --  open "input" file in the current working directory
  Open (Input, In_File, "__Path__" & "input");
  while not End_Of_File (Input) loop
     Get_Line (Input, Text, Last_Pos);
     Put_Line (Text (1 .. 3));
  end loop;
  Close (Input);

#+end_src

#+end_example

To use =:var= argument in the same way as it is implemented in other programming
languages, first provide the type:

#+begin_example

#+begin_src ada :var __Baud_Rate__=115_200, __Parity__=none

  subtype Baud_Rate_Type is Natural with
     Static_Predicate => Baud_Rate_Type in 300 | 1_200 | 2_400 | 4_800 | 9_600 |
                                   19_200 | 38_400 | 57_600 | 115_200 | 230_400;
  type Parity_Type is (even, odd, none);

  Baud_Rate : Baud_Rate_Type := __Baud_Rate__;
  Parity    : Parity_Type    := __Parity__;

#+end_src

#+end_example

** Sessions
Ada and SPARK are compiled programming languages, so there is no support for
sessions.

** Result Types
At the moment no result types are supported. Future releases will take care of
the possibility of handling different types of results.

** Other
Ada/SPARK support for Babel is not so different from other compiled languages, like C
or C++.

* Examples of Use
** Hello World
The hello world example.

#+BEGIN_SRC ada

  with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

  procedure Hello_World is
  begin
     Put_Line ("Hello, world!");
  end Hello_World;

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [ result will appear here ]

** Hello World using templates and variables
#+begin_example
#+header: :var __String__="Hello, world!"
#+end_example
#+BEGIN_SRC ada :template proc-main :var __String__="Hello, world!"

  Put_Line ("__String__");

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [ result will appear here ]

** Formal proof
SPARK tools can analyze the =Increment= function specified below and formally
prove that the implementation is correct. That is:

  * there is no overflow
  * the function does what is specified in the contracts (=Pre= and =Post=
    clauses)
  * the function does not depends on global variables
  * the result depends exclusively on the input parameter

#+BEGIN_SRC ada :prove t :unit increment

  function Increment (X : Integer) return Integer with
    SPARK_Mode  => On,
    Global => (input => null),
    Depends => (Increment'Result => X),
    Pre => X < Integer'Last,
    Post => (Increment'Result <= Integer'Last) and
            (Increment'Result = X + 1)
  is
  begin
      return X + 1;
  end Increment;

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [ result will appear here ]
